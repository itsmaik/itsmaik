- 👋 Hi there, Its Maik here.
- 👀 I am very interested in technology and its potential to enhance our lives. I have a natural aptitude and love for administration, teamwork and people development.
-  My biggest goal is to implement technological solutions to make people's lives easier and better.
-  My greatest strength lies in maintaining a very open mindset, which enables me to embrace new challenges and continuously evolve in the dynamic field of technology.
- 🌱 I am currently in my second year of studying Front-end Development at Noroff and my first year in Systems Analysis and Development at Faculdade Católica Paulista, complementing my prior bachelor's degree in Administration.
- 💞️ I'm excited to contribute to projects where technology intersects with social impact. My enthusiasm lies in applying my developing skills, specially in front-end development, to create solutions that make a positive difference in people's lives.
